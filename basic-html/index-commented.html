  <!-- This is a comment in HTML. It will not appear anywhere in the
  web browser. -->

  <!-- We always start the document with the <html> tag. This tells
  the browser the file we're giving it is coded in HTML. -->

  <head>

    <!-- The <head> contains content we (generally) do not see. -->

    <title>My web page</title>

    <!-- The contents of the <title> tag appear in a browser tab. -->

  </head>


  <body>

    <!-- The <body> contains all content we see in the web browser.
    Think of it as your canvas! -->

    <h1>My First Web Page</h1>

    <!-- Heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc ... up to <h6>) are HTML's
    versions of headlines, subheads, sub-subheads. They establish
    an informational hierarchy. Do not use them in order. Use them in
    the way you would for outlining information. -->

    <p>This is a sentence.</p>

    <!-- The <p> (paragraph) is pretty much the most common tag. If
    your content isn't in a list, it will probably be wrapped in
    <p> tags. -->

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>

    <!-- We're starting a subsection which demonstrates lists. This
    is why we're using an <h2>. We'll have three sections in our
    'Lists' section, therefore, we'll use an <h3> for each of those.
    When we're done with 'Lists', we'll create a new section and
    use an <h2>. -->

    <!-- When we create lists, there are two parts: 1. the type of list
    and 2. the list items. We cannot use the list items by themselves.
    We must discern what kind of list those items are a part of!

    Ordered lists will preface each item with a number; unordered lists
    preface items with bullets. -->

    <ol>
      <li>California</li>
      <li>Texas</li>
      <li>Florida</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Here, the order of our list matters; it indicates the order of
    U.S. states by highest population.

    Notice when as the <ol> tag is open, we indent our tags. This is
    called 'nesting'. We should be nesting our tags throughout the HTML
    document. -->

    <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>cat</li>
      <li>fish</li>
      <li>dog</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- By using <ul>, we're saying the order of the list items does
    not matter. -->

    <h3>Definition Lists</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>hurricane</dt>
      <dd>A tropical storm with winds greater than 74 <abbr title="miles per hour">mph</abbr>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <!-- Definition lists are slightly different. They require two
    parts: the term (<dt>) and definition (<dd>). This format is ideal
    for glossaries. -->

    <!-- Some notes about the <abbr> tag. It is used to identify
    abbreviations or acronyms. By itself, it doesn't have much value.
    We use an attribute - - title - - and the value provides the detail
    about what the abbreviation means; in this case, mph means "miles
    per hour".

    By default, a dotted underline appears under text wrapped in an <abbr>
    tag when a title attribute is included. (If there's no title attribute,
    it looks ... unchanged.) When a user hovers over the text, a tooltip
    will appear with the contents of the title. -->
